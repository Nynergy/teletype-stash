## Notes

'Bosanquet' is still under development, and has bugs that are currently being
worked on. However, it is still very usable, and you can find some demos of me
using it during development below:
- [Heat Distortions](https://youtu.be/qmOsjFNaGb0)
- [Of One Accord](https://youtu.be/bDa-lUiuPKo)
- [Almost Yesterday](https://youtu.be/mEsHZewzpFg)
- [Empty Adrift](https://youtu.be/NwgAgQYa9vU)
